## Color
"Color is an attribute of visual sensation"(page 58, [*Color Apperance Models, Third Edition*](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118653128)). 

An object's color is determined by three aspects: 
1. The light source (_A source of visible electromagnetic energy_), 
2. The physical and chemical properties of the object, which modulate the electromagnetic energy (_e.g., What and how much light does the object reflect, refract, and absorb?_),
3. The human visual system, which detects the modulated electromagnetic energy through photoreceptors and processes by neural mechanisms.

## Colorimetry
The measurement of color.
