## Intro of Wei
I am a PhD student in [VIXI lab](https://vixi.cs.uvic.ca/), University of Victoria. My research interest span from `Visualization`, `Physicalization`, to `Cognitive Augmentation` and more generally, `Interaction Design`. I was a Computer Science MSc in [ilab](https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary. Before that, I acquired Bachelor in SouthWest JiaoTong University, Chengdu, China. 

I am a traveler who just started to make it a hobby, a programmer who is poor in algorithm, a designer who has radical ideas, a gamer who keeps trying after repeated defeats and a reader who loves history, sci-fi, fantasy, as well as traditional literature.
