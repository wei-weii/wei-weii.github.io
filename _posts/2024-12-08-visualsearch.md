## What is visual search?
Looking for a specfic item in a visual scene (page 105, [*active vision The Psychology of Looking and Seeing*](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524793.001.0001)). 

## Why is visual search (important)?
Humans are uncapable to process all the visual information of a visual stimulus at the same time (page 27, [*The Handbook of Attention*](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/10033.003.0004)). In most cases, we want to extract the gist or the most interesting parts in a snap, i.e., find the 'target' as fast as possile. 

Psychologically speaking, by studying visual search, psychologists are interested in:

    1. what characteristics of a stimulus facilitate fast search (AKA, parallel search),
    2. what is the role of attention in this process (preattentive vs. attentive),
    3. what is the neural basis of search visual search.

Personally speaking, from the perspective of my research interest - visualization design, how to design visualization, so it conveys the main points in an efficient and effective way, relies on a comprehensive understanding of humans' vision system. A better understanding of visul search will provide more solid guidelines for visualization design.     


## How is visual search (studied)?
**Employed tasks** (see [paper](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0012780))
- Detection. Signal the presence or absence of a target
- Localization. Report the location of a target
- Identification. Report the type of a target, normally there are two types of targets


**A few concepts**:


- Preattentive stage (process).  Neisser introduced the idea of preattentive stage, in which processing "must be genuinely 'global' and 'wholistic'" (page 85, [Cognitive Psychology](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315736174)) 
- Attentive stage (process). The process that requires the deployment of attention.
- Feature search. Visual search in which target-distractor differentiate in a *feature* (one of the features that Treisman et al. claim are processed in parallel).
- Conjunction search. As opposed to feature search, conjuction search is visual search in which target-distractor differentiate in a combination of *feature*s. 
- Parallel search.
- Serial search.
- Covert attention. "used to describe attending without looking, often colloquially termed looking out of the corner of the eye"
- Overt attention. "the term we will use to describe attending by means of looking". The definition of covert attention and overt attention are from [*active vision The Psychology of Looking and Seeing*](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524793.001.0001), page 3.

**Two theories**:

- <span style="color:#9c755f">FIT (Feature Integration Theory)</span>. FIT is the most influential theory that tries to model visual search. Proposed by Anne Treisman (doi:10.1037/0033-295X.95.1.15), _FIT claims that a set of *features* are processed (more specifically, registered to a feature map) "early, automatically and in parallel across the visual field". This is then followed by a "binding" stage that "glues" features together into specific perceptual objects, which requires focused attention and is processed serially_. Identified *features* include <span style="color:#FF7043">color, size, orientation, motion, curvature</span>. (page 28, [*The Handbook of Attention*](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/10033.003.0004)), which Treisman argued that could be processed 'preattentively', in parallel. A detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of _features_ can be found in the Chapter 2 of the [Oxford Handbook of Attention](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199675111.001.0001)  Thus a visual search task will be accomplished in a fast way if the target-distractors difference is defined by a *feature* (feature search). Otherwise (conjunction search), the search will be serial and slow.  


- <span style="color:#9c755f">Guided Search</span>. Guided search is proposed by [Wolfe et al.](https://doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419) The original version of guided search borrows the two-steps logic of FIT theory. The key idea of guided search is that "preattentive feature information could be used to 'guide' the serial deployment of attention". _The main difference between guided search an FIT is "FIT proposed a dichotomy between parallel and serial search tasks, GS proposed a continuum based on the effectiveness of guidance_."(see [paper](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-020-01859-9)). Wolfe and his colleagues continue to refine the guided search theory, primarily by updating the sources of guidance. The newest one is [Guided Search 6.0](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-020-01859-9), published in 2021. Nonetheless, preattentive features remain as the number one form of guidence.
