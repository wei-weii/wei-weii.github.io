## Wei's Research Notes
In this blog, I want to build a ultra-simplified wikipedia for some common concepts and knowledge in visualization research or paper writing, in the form of answering the question **What is X?** and **How to use X?** As you may have noticed, it's not completed, a lot of questions are to be answered:\).

### Study Type
#### What is Co-design Study?
Co-design is a design approach that emphasizes the integration of domain knowledge and iterative prototyping through collaboration between diverse stakeholders.  [*It refers to the collective creativity of collaborating designers \[...\]and people not trained in design working together in the design development process.*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710880701875068). 
#### What is Participatory Study?

#### What is Formative Study?
A formative study in Computer Science refers to a small-scale research method conducted during product development to identify issues, gather user feedback, and make improvements based on findings without providing metrics or statistics.

#### What is Speculative Study?
[Speculative design: crafting the speculation](https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2013.767276)


### Qualitative Data Analysis

#### What is Thematic Analysis?
>Thematic analysis is a method for developing, analysing and interpreting patterns across a qualitative dataset, which involves systematic processes of data coding and to develop themes - themes are your ultimate analytic purpose (page 4 [*Thematic Analysis: A Practical Guide*](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/thematic-analysis/book248481)).
#### What is Open Coding?
#### What is Grounded Theory?
#### What is Diffractive Qualitative Data Analysis?
Diffractive qualitative analysis is a method that utilized multiple theoretical readings of data to generate new insights and perspectives, often exploring the complexities of lived experiences and challenging traditional interpretations.

#### What is autoethnography?
Autoethnography is [a first-person research method that intertwines personal experiences with academic inquiry](https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642355).
It utilizes the researcherâ€™s personal experience to describe and systematically analyse cultural or social phenomena, thereby positioning the researcher simultaneously as the subject of the inquiry and as the researcher (ibid.). A relevant concept is autobiographical design, in which researchers generate and evaluate novel artefacts through personal usage.


## How to Use Punctuations?
### Quotation Mark
Double quotation marks are used for direct quotations and titles of compositions such as books, plays, and movies. They also can be used to indicate irony and introduce an unfamiliar term or nickname.

Single quotation marks are used for a quote within a quote. 

**A period or comma always go inside closing quotation marks**. A dash, semicolon, question mark, and exclamation point go inside closing quotation marks when the punctuation applies to the quotation itself and outside when it applies to the whole sentence.

### Apostrophe
Do not use apostrophe for contraction in paper. Try not use apostrophe for omission unless it is widely adapted.

### Colon and Semicolon
A colon is used to *give emphasis*, *present dialogue*, *introduce lists or text*, and *clarify composition titles*

A semicolon has two uses: to *clarify a series* and to *indicate two closely related sentences*

### Ellipsis

An ellipsis should be treated as a three-letter word, with a space, three periods, and a space. 

When the words before an ellipsis make up a complete sentence, place a period before the ellipsis and separate the period and ellipsis with a space. 

### Hyphen and Dash
A hyphen is used to link parts of a compound word. *Hyphen should not be used for emphasis or denote a break or pause*.

A dash is used in place of a comma, colon for greater emphasis. *It denotes a major break or pause and should not be overused*.
Spaces are not needed before or after the dash.

### Parentheses
Parentheses can be used to insert explanatory or qualifying material that you want to de-emphasize, or information that doesn't fit naturally into the flow of your text. **Try best to avoid parentheses**.

Place a period outside a closing parenthesis if the material inside is not a sentence, otherwise, place inside.

**If removing a parenthetical note changes the meaning of the sentence, it should not be in parentheses.**

### Slash
'/' is a slash, '\' is a backslash. A slash is used in text to separate alternatives (good/evil) and to separate lines of poetry. Do not use slash to separate alternatives when using "and" or "or" would suffice. 

Avoid the phrase "and/or."
