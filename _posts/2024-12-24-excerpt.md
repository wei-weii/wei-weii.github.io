## This is my excerpt from books I read.

*WALDEN, or LIFE IN THE WOODS*

> Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance

> The stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and different beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the same one at the same moment!

> Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have.

> The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.

*Fear and Trembling*

> If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair?

*红拂夜奔*

> 有关人随时在想什么，我只知道一个例子，就是我自己。别人不可能把一切都告诉我，所以我只好推己及人。在统计学上可以证明，以一个例子的样本来推论无限总体，这种方法十分之坏。安妮·弗兰克就犯了这种错误，从自己是善良的推出所有人都是善良的，虽然这份善良被深藏在心里，这个推论简直是黑色幽默。但是在这件事上没有别的方法了。到目前为止，没有一件事能让我相信我是对的，就是人生来有趣，过去有趣，渴望有趣，内心有趣却假装无趣。也没有一件事证明我是错的，让我相信人生来无趣，过去无趣现在也无趣，不喜欢有趣的事而且表里如一。**所以到目前为止，我只能强忍着绝望活在这个世界上**。


*寻找无双*

> 王仙客临终时说， 他始终也没搞清什么是现实，什么是梦。在他看来，苦苦地思索无双去了哪里，就像是现实，因为现实总是具有一种苦涩味。而篱笆上的两层花，迎面走来的穿紫棠木屐的妓女，四面是窗户的小亭子，刺鼻子的粗肥皂味，以及在心中萦绕不去的鱼玄机，等等，就像是一个梦。 梦具有一种荒诞的真实性，而真实有一种真实的荒诞性。除了这种感觉上的差异， 他说不出这两者之间有什么区别。
>王安老爹说过，世界上的人除了我们就是奸党。


*Data Feminism*

> The 7 principles of Data feminism
1. Examine Power
2. Challenge Power
3. Elevate Emotion and Embodiment
4. Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies
5. Embrace Pluralism
6. Consider Context
7. Make Labor Visible

> The matrix of domination (structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, interpersonal) works to uphold the undue privilege of dominant groups while unfairly oppressing minoritized groups.
