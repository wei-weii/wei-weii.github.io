# You're whirling in rags. You're vast and you're sad.

*WALDEN, or LIFE IN THE WOODS*

> Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance

> The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.

> The stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and different beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the same one at the same moment!

> Most men appear never to have have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have.
