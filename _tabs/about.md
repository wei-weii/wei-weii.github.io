## About Me

I am a PhD student in [VIXI lab](https://vixi.cs.uvic.ca/), University of Victoria. My research interest span from `Visualization`, `Physicalization`, to `Cognitive Augmentation` and more generally, `Interaction Design`. I was a Computer Science MSc in [ilab](https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary. Before that, I acquired Bachelor in SouthWest JiaoTong University, Chengdu, China. 

I am a traveler who just started to make it a hobby, a programmer who is poor in algorithm, a designer who has radical ideas, a gamer who keeps trying after repeated defeats and a reader who loves history, sci-fi, fantasy, as well as traditional literature.

### Visualizing the Three Kingdoms: The Lifespan, Network, and Homeland of Heroes and Beyond

Ancient Chinese history is mostly documented in the `Twenty-Four Histories`, the 24 official dynastic records spanning from the earliest dynasty in 3000 BC to the Ming dynasty in the 17th century. These historical accounts uniformly adopted a method of chronicling the lives of 'significant' figures, including emperors, concubines, ministers, heroes, warlords, etc., in the form of biography. Inadvertently, this approach also generated prosopographies of individuals deemed `less significant' during that era. Much of Chinese history research involves analyzing these extensive biographical texts to discern and model overarching patterns. Conventionally, this work was carried out through manual reading and analysis of texts, which is an exceedingly time-consuming and cost-inefficient process. With the digitization of these texts and advancements in information technology, there is promise for improvement in this area.

Biographic data are inherently multidimensional and time-oriented.
Various well-established visualization methods have been employed to analyze biographic data, including `timeline` for time-oriented data, `network` for relational data, and `map` for geotemporal data. While these approaches have been well studied and gradually adopted in Western history research, as far as my knowledge extends, there remains a notable gap in the research of ancient Chinese history regarding harnessing the benefits of visualization. 

Motivated by this gap, I am developing a portfolio that explores the application of these methods in synthesizing and extracting insights from one of the `Twenty-Four Histories`, `Sanguozhi` - `Records of the Three Kingdoms`. This compilation chronicles China's history from 180 CE to 284 CE, which is one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. 

### Towards Autocomplete Strategies for Visualization Construction

Constructive visualization uses physical data units - `tokens` -  to enable non-experts to create personalized visualizations engagingly. However, its physical nature limits efficiency and scalability. One potential solution to address this issue is autocomplete. By providing automated suggestions while still allowing for manual intervention, autocomplete can expedite visualization construction while maintaining expressivity. We conduct a speculative design study to examine how people would like to interact with a visualization authoring system that supports autocomplete. Our study identifies three types of autocomplete strategies and gains insights for designing future visualization authoring tools with autocomplete functionality.

### Anthropomorphizing AVs: Leveraging Human Cues for Designing AV-Pedestrian Interactions

![ The three anthropomorphic AV interfaces](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/antimelee/media-Pages/image/AnthroAV.png)

`Expressions`, `gestures`, and `body language` are fundamental to human communication. Our work explores their potential benefits and limitations within Autonomous Vehicle (AV)-pedestrian interactions. We designed three anthropomorphic interfaces for AVs: facial expressions, hand gestures, and humanoid torsos. With these designs, we contribute a preliminary design critique to understand the strengths and weaknesses of specific anthropomorphic interfaces, a realization of these AV interfaces in an immersive VR testbed which allows pedestrians to make physical crossing decisions, and an evaluation of our testbed through a user study. Our findings suggest that AV interfaces with a higher degree of human likeness receive more favourable responses from pedestrians. Additionally, interfaces which incorporate intuitive, dynamic, and unambiguous features outperform others. Our results also highlight that some anthropomorphic AV interfaces may be efficient while not necessarily guaranteeing a high level of pedestrian comfort.
