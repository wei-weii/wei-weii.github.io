# Know Wei in 30s
I am a PhD student in the [VIXI lab](https://vixi.cs.uvic.ca/), University of Victoria, under the supervision of Prof. Charles Perin and Miguel Nacenta. My research interest span from `visualization`, `physicalization`, to `cognitive augmentation` and more generally, `interaction design`. I was a research intern at Télécom Paris with Prof. [Samuel Huron](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/shuron/#!index.md). Before that, I had an incredible MSc (under the instruction of Prof. Ehud Sharlin) at [ilab](https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary, possibly the best experience of my academic journey. 

I am a traveler who just started to make it a hobby, a programmer who is poor in algorithm, a designer who has radical ideas, a gamer who keeps trying after repeated defeats and a reader who loves history, sci-fi, fantasy, as well as Chinese classics.

- ## Visualizing the Three Kingdoms: The Lifespan, Network, and Homeland of Heroes and Beyond
 
As an **ongoing** and hobby-oriented project, I am collecting and maintaining a [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c7hnmNIeD9X5W6P7Wx2E4V9_g49-ShKPHRUv_ad3ozw/edit?usp=sharing) that aims to log all individuals recorded in [Sanguozhi - Records of the Three Kingdoms](https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%9C%8B%E5%BF%97), a Chinese history classic that chronicles China's history from 180 CE to 284 CE. You can find more info about it on the [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Three_Kingdoms). At this moment, the data sheet has more than 1500 entries. In the future, I will turn it into a open-source project and maybe create a database for it.
Furthermore, I am developing a portfolio that explore the potential of employing visualization approaches (`timeline`, `network`, `map`, and more) to synthesize and extract insights from Sanguozhi.
